# PGM-image-filling
This repository contains a C++ project that utilises Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) to reconstruct images from the MNIST dataset where parts of the images are masked.
This project focuses on creating detailed reconstructions by inferring missing pixels. Additionally, the repository includes Python scripts for evaluating the performance of the reconstruction algorithms, comparing them on various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices and visualisation of the reconstructed images.

**Features:**
- Implementation of image reconstruction using PGM in C++
- Use of MNIST dataset to demonstrate effectiveness in handling digit images
- Application of masks to original MNIST images to simulate partial data loss
- Performance evaluation scripts in Python to analyze accuracy and efficiency
- Detailed documentation on the methodologies used and the results obtained

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the C++ directory to review the PGM implementation and compile the code according to the provided instructions at the top of the main.cc file.
3. Run the C++ executable to process the MNIST images and create reconstructions.
4. Navigate to the Python directory to run the performance evaluation scripts. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
5. Review the generated reports and visual comparisons to understand the performance of the reconstruction algorithms.

This project is ideal for researchers and practitioners interested in the application of PGM in image processing and offers insights into handling incomplete image data effectively.
